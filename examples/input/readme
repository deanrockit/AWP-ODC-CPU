Note: All these inputs are for 128x128x128 case or 152x102x128 (for SGSN model) case
      For validation purpose, each case use different FAULTPOW, located in input/ inside each case directory.

input files included:

1. MEDIA128.be
	 - big-endian velocity structure file for both dynamic mode and wave propagation mode

   MEDIA128.le
	 - little-endian velocity structure file for both dynamic mode and wave propagation mode

2. MEDIADYN128
	- initial stress file for dynamic mode, with IDYNA=0 in SETTING file; for 128x128x128 case

3. prob3dx03in.dat
	- mt based fault file for SGSN/dynamic mode, with IDYNA=1 in SETTING file; for 152x102x128 case 

4. FAULTPOW
	- mt based fault file for wave propogation mode, for 128x128x128 case
        - old one in ASCII format
        - NST=91

5. FAULTPOW.90nst.be
        - fault file in binary format, NST = 90, big endian

6. FAULTPOW.90nst.le
        - fault file in binary format, NST = 90, little endian

7. FAULTPOW.be
        - fault file in binary format, NST = 91, big endian

8. FAULTPOW.le
        - fault file in binary format, NST = 91, little endian

Partitioning examples in example directories:

1. MeshPartitioning
   - partition MEDIA128.le based on 2x2x2 configuration

2. SourcePartitioning
   - partition FAULTOW.90nst.bin based on 2x2x2 configuration, 10 time stepping
